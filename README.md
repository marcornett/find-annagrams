# Program Plan

1.  Read the requirements document in detail.
    - Take notes of things you'll need to do
    - Write down any questions
2.  Get the answers to your questions!
3.  Make a development plan
    - Describe the entire behavior of your program in 3 (or at most 4) steps
    - Break down each step into 3 (or 4) steps
    - Repeat until each step is obvious how to code it
4.  Write the code!

5.  How do I access the words.js in my javascript file to compare the input to the list?
6.  How do I understand the instruction better so I can visualize the order of how these functions should be written?

# Development Plan

1.  Collect user inputted data
    1.  Create a input and button tag.
    2.  Activate a function once clicked
    3.  Grab the value
2.  Organize this data alphabetically
    1.  Take the value from data and pass into alphabetize function
3.  Compare this to a list which also needs to be alphabetized by each input
    (e.g. "least" and "steal" look like "aelst")
    1.  Alphabetize the list of words
    2.  Check if alphabetized input is the same as any of the words in the alphabetized list
        1.  Use if else statement to create new span or div and write in those original values
    3.  If they are the same then display in a new content box.
